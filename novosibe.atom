We wanted to create a timepiece that embodied the daring actions of those that went before us.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The 42mm DLC coated case encapsulates a dial filled with dark shades and tones that represent the early WW2 night operations. The oversized indices and grey hands are filled with Super-LumiNova which makes the dial clear and easy to read at all hours. The handset is beautifully finished with a crisp red outlining to the seconds hand that allows you to track H-hour with precision. Its casing is complemented by a ceramic dive bezel that acts as a nod to the aquatic operations these raids typically came from.</span></p>

We wanted to create a timepiece that embodied the daring actions of those that went before us.</span></p>
<p data-mce-fragment="1"><span data-mce-fragment="1" style="font-weight: 400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">The 42mm DLC coated case encapsulates a dial filled with dark shades and tones that represent the early WW2 night operations. The oversized indices and grey hands are filled with SuperLuminova which makes the dial clear and easy to read at all hours. The handset is beautifully finished with a crisp red outlining to the seconds hand that allows you to track H-hour with precision. Its casing is complemented by a ceramic dive bezel that acts as a nod to the aquatic operations these raids typically came from.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gibson is a true pilot’s watch that takes inspiration from historical aviation timepieces with a sleek updated design to suit today's skies. Designed and developed with specifications that today's pilots can be confident in, it was designed for the cockpit but can be worn for any occasion.<br><br></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first watch of the Stirling range to feature the SW200 automatic movement, this Swiss made movement is certified for high levels of accuracy at a range of temperatures and finds itself in the top 6% of Swiss movements for accuracy. <br><br></span>The classy DLC finished stainless steel case design has been produced to fit comfortably on the wrist whilst wearing a flight suit or gloves.
